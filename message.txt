This project demonstrates how encrypted data can be transmitted over an audio channel using robust frequency shift keying. A plaintext message is first encrypted with AES-256 in CTR mode to ensure confidentiality. The encrypted bytes are then placed inside a structured frame that includes a magic header, payload length, and a CRC32 checksum for integrity verification. To improve reliability in noisy conditions, each bit is repetition coded before modulation.

The modulator converts bits into two distinct carrier frequencies within the telephone band: 1200 Hz represents binary zero and 2200 Hz represents binary one. A synchronization preamble is added at the beginning of the transmission so the receiver can detect where the data starts. The final waveform is written to a standard mono WAV file at 44.1 kHz. Optionally, the modulated signal can be mixed into a cover audio file to make the transmission less noticeable.

On the receiving side, the WAV file is loaded and preprocessed by removing DC offset, normalizing amplitude, and applying a band-pass filter to isolate the target frequency range. The receiver scans for the preamble, aligns the bit boundaries, and detects each bit using phase-robust I/Q energy comparison between the two carrier frequencies. Majority voting corrects minor errors. After reconstructing the frame and validating the CRC, the ciphertext is decrypted to recover the original message.

To use the system, run the sender with a message to generate an encoded WAV file, then pass that file to the receiver to decode and decrypt it.
