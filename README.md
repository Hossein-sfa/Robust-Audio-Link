# Robust-Audio-Link
Robost Audio Link is a secure audio data transmission system that encrypts messages using AES-256-CTR and modulates them with robust phone-band BFSK (1200/2200 Hz). It uses framing, CRC32 integrity checks, repetition coding, and phase-robust I/Q detection to reliably recover encrypted data from WAV audio, even under moderate noise and compression.
